# operationalize-machine-learning-microservice-api
Operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. Main aim of the project is to containerize the python flask-app and deploy the container in Kubernetes cluster. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.
